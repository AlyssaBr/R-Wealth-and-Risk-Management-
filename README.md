# Introduction

This study provides an in-depth risk and return analysis customised for a high net worth
customer with a sizeable portfolio of 94 million USD who lives in Palo Alto, California. With
17.5% invested in IXN (equity), 22.1% in QQQ (equity), 28.5% in IEF (fixed income), 8.9% in
VNQ (real assets), and 23% in GLD (commodities). The client's investment profile looks to be
somewhat balanced based on the information given. The distribution of assets among various
asset classes suggests a diversification strategy, which is frequently linked to a balanced strategy.
An aggressive profile would have a larger share of stocks and riskier assets, whereas a
conservative profile would generally have a bigger allocation to fixed-income assets.
The client appears to have a mix of equities for growth potential, fixed income for stability and
income, exposure to real assets and commodities for diversification.

The goal of this study is to see which assests can be changed in their percentagde of the portfolio or replaced in its entirety.
